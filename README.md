This is the source code of g30l0, an abas Essentials App build on the abas Essentials SDK.

## General setup
If you are using proxies, add a gradle.properties file to your $GRADLE_USER_HOME.

```
#If you use a proxy add it here
systemProp.http.proxyHost=<webproxy>
systemProp.http.proxyPort=<port>
systemProp.https.proxyHost=<webproxy>
systemProp.https.proxyPort=<port>
```

Run `./initGradleProperties.sh` in your terminal (use Git Bash on Windows)

Use your favorite IDE to import the project.

## Installation
To install the project make sure you are running the docker-compose.yml file 
or else change the gradle.properties file accordingly to use another erp client 
(you will still need a nexus server, but it can of course also be installed in your erp installation 
or elsewhere as long as it is configured in the gradle.properties file).

To use the project's docker-compose.yml file, in the project's root directory run:
```shell
docker login --username <extranet user> --password <extranet password> sdp.registry.abas.sh
docker-compose up
```

Now you can install the project as follows:
```shell
./gradlew fullInstall
```
## Development
You can make changes such as manipulating the app's logic or adding/removing components.

First install the app as described in [Installation](##Installation) using:
```shell
./gradlew fullInstall
``` 

To deploy your changes run:
```shell
./gradlew syncCode
```
